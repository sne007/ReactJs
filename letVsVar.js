// let vs const 
// let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is 
// used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block s // cope. An explanation of why the name "let" was chosen can be found here.
